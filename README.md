# cart — session 2 starter

Run the test first and watch it fail:

```bash
npm test
```

## What to implement

`cartTotal(items, options)` in `src/cart.js`. Plain JavaScript, **no dependencies**.

- `items`: `[{ name, price, qty }]` · `options`: `{ vatRate, freeShipFrom, shipFee }`
- `subtotal` = sum of `price × qty`
- VAT = `vatRate` applied to the subtotal
- shipping = `0` when `subtotal >= freeShipFrom`, otherwise `shipFee`
- return `subtotal + VAT + shipping`, **a number**, rounded to the whole đồng
- an empty cart returns `0` — no VAT, no shipping
- a negative `price`, or a `qty` that is not a positive integer, throws `RangeError`

Worked example: 2 × 180000 + 1 × 45000 = 405000 subtotal, VAT 32400,
shipping 30000 (below the 500000 threshold) → **467400**.

## What you hand in

One zip named `<StudentID>_<total>.zip` — the total being the mark you give
yourself against the rubric — containing:

1. This repository, with `npm test` green
2. The brief you gave your assistant
3. `AI-LOG.md` — template on Classroom
4. `SELF_ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md` — template on Classroom, one row per rubric
   criterion with evidence

The rubric is attached to the assignment on Classroom. Read it before you start:
30 of the 100 marks are for behaviour, and they are checked by running your code.
